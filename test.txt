Hi Pridney,

here is the test guidelines for backend developer
- Create rest app by Node.Js
- Host you app on heroku
- Use mongolab's free sandbox as database
- Secure your app by jsonwebtokens (you can use auth0 free developer 
account and examples to auth your user)
- Handle stripe payments via api and save all payments to database with 
transcaction ids and other relevant information
- Host you code on bitbucket or github and share (admin) permissions to 
sampsa@booni.fi
- Create simple frontend app to test backend endpoints


Even if you can't finish the test completely, please send us the test 
files in this day for a code review though github. Thank you.

Best,
Jero
